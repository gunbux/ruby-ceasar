<h1>Ceasar Cipher using Ruby</h1>

<p>Project idea taken from The Odin Project</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<p>Detailed step by step process</p>
<ol>
    <li>Take an input from the user, the string to be encrypted, and the number of shifts</li>
    <li>Convert the string to its relative number and shift it via the number of shifts. Remember to wrap z to a</li>
    <li>Check for casing and return the same casing</li>
</ol>

<p>Assignment Review</p>
<p>Time taken: 2-3 hours over 2 days</p>
<p>A few mistakes here and there, but rather painless implementation, with minimal debugging required. Forgot about the wrapping z to a initially, but fixed it quite easily.</p>
